</h3>
<p>In order to attribute an investee companies production or climate
alignment results to a financial portfolio a weighting method is
required. This methodology note describes the share ownership
attribution method for listed equity holdings. This weighting method is
based on the individual shares owned by an investor.</p>
<p>Other possible weighting methods for listed equity include equity
ownership, which weights based on the market value of the shares held,
and voting influence, which weights based on the number of AGM votes
associated with the shares held.</p>

<h3 id="defining-share-ownership">1.2 Defining share ownership<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-share-ownership"></a>
</h3>
<p>Share ownership in the context of PACTA refers to the act of holding
a proportion of the publicly listed shares of a given company. Each
share, also sometimes referred to as stock, represents an ownership
stake in the company that confers the holder with rights to a share of
the dividends and/or influence on company decision making.</p>

<h2 id="the-share-ownership-weight-attribution-method">2. The share ownership weight attribution method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-share-ownership-weight-attribution-method"></a>
</h2>
<p>The share ownership weight method is one of several methods that can
be used to attribute a companies production or climate performance to a
financial portfolio based on the percentage of a companies outstanding
public shares that are held.</p>
<p>For holdings in a given entity, share ownership weight is defined as
the total number of outstanding shares in all classes of shares within
scope held by the investor (the numerator) divided by the total number
of outstanding shares for the entity across all listed security issuance
for the entity (the denominator). Each listed security issuance is
denoted by an ISIN in the dataset.</p>

</h3>
<p>A number of different classes of shares may be issued as part of a
public listing. These include</p>
<ul>
<li>Common share capital (EQ) that confers the holder with voting rights
at the Annual General Meeting.</li>
<li>Preferred share capital (PF) that confers the holder with specific
rights to dividend payments but are not accompanied by voting
rights.</li>
<li>Convertible share capital (CP) confers a right to convert the
preferred shares with a fixed income stream to common shares at a future
date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common and preferred shares will have different prices and may be
also be issued in distinct share classes, such as A, B, and R. These
shared classes are targeted at specific types of investors and may have
different share prices, administrative costs and associated voting
rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case study: Duke Energy – preferred share class</strong></p>
<p>The screenshot below presents the common and preferred shares that
Duke Energy has issued on listed stock exchanges. The first two ISINs in
the list are preferred shares, and the third ISIN represents common
shares.</p>
<p>The market capitalization of the company is the the sum of the market
value (price multiplied by outstanding shares) of all the company’s
ISINs, and the number of shares issued by the company is the sum of the
number of shares outstanding at security level. In this case
770.08+40.00+10.00=820.08 million outstanding shares. The column “Shares
Out” reflects the total common outstanding shares.</p>

<p><em>How should these types of shares be treated?</em></p>
<p>All common equity shares (EQ), preferred shares (PF) and Convertible
preferred shares (CP) are to be included in the total of the numerator
and denominator.</p>
<p><em>How should the number of shares be back calculated from the

<p>In order to derive the number of shares the market value of
outstanding shares held by an investor should be divided by the market

<h3 id="treasury-shares">4.2 Treasury shares<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#treasury-shares"></a>
</h3>
<p>Treasury shares are common or preferred shares that have been bought
back by an issuer or were never publicly issued and are instead held by
the issuer on their balance sheet. These shares are not strictly a class
of shares and are not included within outstanding share values provided
by FactSet. For the purposes of calculating the share ownership weight
treasury shares are therefore excluded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case study: Airbus – treasury shares</strong></p>
<p>Airbus issued shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Around 25% of
the shares are held as treasury by the company and are not available in
the market, as can be seen in the chart below. Those shares are excluded
from calculations of the denominator as institutions cannot buy those
assets on the market.</p>
<p><img src="Airbus_1.png" id="id" class="class" style="width:45.0%"><img src="Airbus_2.png" id="id" class="class" style="width:45.0%"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>How should these types of shares be treated?</em></p>
<p>Treasury shares should be excluded if they can be identified.</p>

<h3 id="depository-note-adrgdr-isins">4.3 Depository note (ADR/GDR) ISINs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#depository-note-adrgdr-isins"></a>
</h3>
<p>Depositary notes are used in the US and other jurisdictions globally
to enable investors to purchase non-US shares issued on exchanges in
other jurisdictions. The shares are purchased by a bank or other
intermediary who issue depositary notes for the value of the shares,
applying currency conversion factors and a corresponding adjustment of
the number of shares.</p>
<p>American Depositary Receipts (ADR) and Global Depositary Receipts
(GDR) are common examples. The holder of ADR or GDR do not directly hold
shares in listed securities issuers, instead they correspond to listed
shares purchased by depositary banks that issue the receipts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case study: BHP Billingdon – US and Argentinian depositary
notes</strong></p>
<p>BHP Billingdon has made on equity share issue against a specific ISIN
on the Australian Stock Exchange market. This is their primary issuance
of listed equity and so the number of shares outstanding of Billingdon
is the one for of the Australian ISIN.</p>
<p>Two issuances of depositary notes have been made against ISINs in the
USA and Argentina, allowing investors there to purchase notes equivalent
to shares bought on the Australian market. Those depositary note shares
therefore represent a proportion of the total outstanding shares of
Billingdon on the Australian market, but to calculate how many the
conversion factor based on the currency exchange rate needs be
applied.</p>
<p><img src="BHP.png" id="id" class="class" style="width:100.0%"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>How should these types of shares be treated?</em></p>
<p>ADR and GDR do in practice represent and are equivalent to indirectly
held listed shares. This means that they should be included in investors
holdings in the total of the numerator. However, a conversion factor
must be applied in order to obtain the correct equivalent number of
shares.</p>
<p><em>How should the number of shares be back calculated from the
market value?</em></p>
<p>In order to derive the number of shares the market value of
outstanding shares held by an investor should be divided by the market
price. A conversion factor must then be applied in order to obtain the
correct equivalent number of equity shares.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dual-listed-share-class-isins">4.4 Dual listed share class ISINs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dual-listed-share-class-isins"></a>
</h3>
<p>In some cases, companies make the same common and preferred share
issuance available on more than one listed exchange, generally referred
to as dual listing. Whilst each issuance on an exchange has a distinct
ISIN, in practice dual listing gives investors in more than one
jurisdiction access to the same pool of equity (the primary
listing).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case study: Stora Enso – dual listing and multiple share
classes in Finland and Sweden</strong></p>
<p>Stora Enso has made two primary issuances in Finland which have then
been made available on another national listed exchange in Sweden. The
primary issuance is traded on the Helsinski Stock Exchange, these are
then dual listed on the Stockholm stock exchange. A depositary note
issuance has also been made in the USA.</p>
<p>The two Dual Listed ISIN can be seen in the data to mirror the two
Finnish ISINs. The data from FactSet shows that the number of shares
outstanding is 788 million, which is the sum of the two Finnish traded
ISIN. The data shows that neither the shares associated with the Dual
Listings nor the ADR listing should be included in the denominator
calculation.</p>
<p><img src="Stora_Enso.png" id="id" class="class" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>However, from an investor’s point of view the three last ISIN are
mirrors of the first two ISIN. This means that in practice if you own
those shares, that still means that the investor either owns, or an
entity has bought on the investors behalf, the same shares in the first
two ISIN, and by transposition you still own those shares, and by
consequence the underlying assets.</p>
<p>Both issuances against the Finnish ISINs are common stocks. They do,
however, differ based on the shares class. The first ISIN is a class A
common stocks and the second ISIN is a class R common stock which
results in different voting rights. The first ISIN will have 10 votes
for a share, while the second one will have 1 vote per share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>How should these types of shares be treated?</em></p>
<p>Whilst the shares held by an investor are directly held securities
and should be included in the total of the numerator, the total shares
outstanding issued across several exchanges cannot be totalled as there
would be a duplication of the shares caused by secondary listings. Only
the shares associated with the primary listing should be totaled in the
denominator.</p>
<p><em>How should the number of shares be back calculated from the
market value?</em></p>
<p>In order to derive the number of shares the market value of
outstanding shares held by an investor should be divided by the market
price.</p>

</h2>
<p>According to the ISIN organization so called ‘corporate actions’ may
result in changes in the status of a company’s securities and their
identifiers<sup>1</sup>. The financial data provider is likely to take
into account these changes and reflect them in updates to the financial
dataset. However, these actions may still need to be taken into account
in the process of calculating the outstanding shares. Corporate actions
of relevance identified by ISIN include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company changes its name: The replacement shares receive a new
ISIN.</li>
<li>A company changes the country in which it is headquartered: A new
ISIN is required only if the company replaces an old security with a new
one.</li>
<li>Merger and acquisition: Old ISINs for stock become inactive and are
replaced by securities with a new ISIN.</li>
<li>New stock issued or changed to stock par value: A new ISIN is only
needed if new stock has different rights or is meant to replace old
stock.</li>
